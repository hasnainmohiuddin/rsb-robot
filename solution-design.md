# Solution Design

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural model for the `tasks.py` script, which automates the process of downloading sales data, filling forms, and exporting results to a PDF.

## Key Components
1. **Browser Automation**
   - Responsible for navigating the web application and performing actions like filling forms and taking screenshots.

2. **Data Handling**
   - Downloads the Excel file containing sales data and processes it to fill in the forms.

3. **PDF Generation**
   - Converts the collected results into a PDF format for reporting.

4. **Logging**
   - Captures the execution flow and errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Interactions
- The **Browser Automation** component interacts with the **Data Handling** component to retrieve and fill data.
- After processing, it calls the **PDF Generation** component to create a report.
- Throughout the process, the **Logging** component records significant events and errors.

## Justifications
- **Modularity**: Each function is designed to perform a specific task, enhancing maintainability.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging ensures robustness and aids in troubleshooting.
- **Environment Variables**: Secure management of sensitive data through environment variables.
